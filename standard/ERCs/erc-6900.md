## Abstract

This proposal standardizes smart contract accounts and account modules, which are smart contract interfaces that allow for composable logic within smart contract accounts. This proposal is compliant with [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md). This standard emphasizes secure permissioning of modules, and maximal interoperability between all spec-compliant accounts and modules.

This modular approach splits account functionality into three categories, implements them in external contracts, and defines an expected execution flow from accounts.

## Motivation

One of the goals that ERC-4337 accomplishes is abstracting the logic for execution and validation to each smart contract account.

Many new features of accounts can be built by customizing the logic that goes into the validation and execution steps. Examples of such features include session keys, subscriptions, spending limits, and role-based access control. Currently, some of these features are implemented natively by specific smart contract accounts, and others are able to be implemented by proprietary module systems like Safe modules.

However, managing multiple account instances provides a worse user experience, fragmenting accounts across supported features and security configurations. Additionally, it requires module developers to choose which platforms to support, causing either platform lock-in or duplicated development effort.

We propose a standard that coordinates the implementation work between module developers and wallet developers. This standard defines a modular smart contract account capable of supporting all standard-conformant modules. This allows users to have greater portability of their data, and for module developers to not have to choose specific account implementations to support.

![diagram showing relationship between accounts and modules with modular functions](../assets/eip-6900/MSCA_Shared_Components_Diagram.svg)

These modules can contain execution logic, validation functions, and hooks. Validation functions define the circumstances under which the smart contract account will approve actions taken on its behalf, while hooks allow for pre and post execution controls.

Accounts adopting this standard will support modular, upgradable execution and validation logic. Defining this as a standard for smart contract accounts will make modules easier to develop securely and will allow for greater interoperability.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Terms

- An **account** (or **smart contract account, SCA**) is a smart contract that can be used to send transactions and hold digital assets. It implements the `IAccount` interface from ERC-4337.
- A **modular account** (or **modular smart contract account, MSCA**) is an account that supports modular functions. There are three types of modular functions:
  - **Validation functions** validate authorization on behalf of the account.
  - **Execution functions** execute custom logic allowed by the account.
  - **Hooks** execute custom logic and checks before and/or after an execution function or validation function.
There are two types of hooks:
    - **Validation hook** functions run before a validation function. These can enforce permissions on actions authorized by a validation function.
    - **Execution hook** functions run can run before and/or after an execution function. The pre execution hook may optionally return data to be consumed by a post execution hook functions.
- A **native function** refers to a function implemented by the modular account, as opposed to a function added by a module.
- A **module** is a deployed smart contract that hosts any amount of the above three kinds of modular functions.
- A module **manifest** describes the execution functions, interface ids, and hooks that should be installed on the account.

### Overview

A modular account handles two kinds of calls: either from the `Entrypoint` through ERC-4337, or through direct calls from externally owned accounts (EOAs) and other smart contracts. This standard supports both use cases.

A call to the smart contract account can be broken down into the steps as shown in the diagram below. The validation steps validate if the caller is allowed to perform the call. The pre execution hook step can be used to do any pre execution checks or updates. It can also be used along with the post execution hook step to perform additional actions or verification. The execution step performs a defined task or collection of tasks.

![diagram showing call flow within an modular account](../assets/eip-6900/Modular_Account_Call_Flow.svg)

Each step is modular, supporting different implementations, that allows for open-ended programmable accounts.

### Interfaces

**Modular Smart Contract Accounts** **MUST** implement

- `IAccount.sol` from [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md).
- `IAccountExecute.sol` from [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md).
- `IModularAccount.sol` to support module management and usage, and account identification.
- The function `isValidSignature` from [ERC-1271](./eip-1271.md)

**Modular Smart Contract Accounts** **MAY** implement

- `IModularAccountView.sol` to support visibility in account states on-chain.
- [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) for interfaces installed from modules.

**Modules** **MUST** implement

- `IModule.sol` described below and implement ERC-165 for `IModule`.

**Modules** **May** implement one of the following module types

- `IValidationModule` to support validations for account.
- `IValidationHookModule` to support hooks for validations.
- `IExecutionModule` to support execution functions and their installations on account.
- `IExecutionHookModule` to support pre & post execution hooks for execution functions.

### Expected behavior

TODO for v0.8

#### Validations and their installation /uninstallation

An account can have more than one validation module/function installed.
An account can have the same validation module installed more than once.
The entityId of a validation function installed on an account MUST be unique.
Validation installation MAY be deferred until a later time, such as upon first use.

#### Calls to `installModule`

The function `installModule` accepts 3 parameters: the address of the module to install, the Keccak-256 hash of the module's manifest, ABI-encoded data to pass to the module's `onInstall` callback.

The function MUST retrieve the module's manifest by calling `moduleManifest()` using `staticcall`.

The function MUST perform the following preliminary checks:

- Revert if the module has already been installed on the modular account.
- Revert if the module does not implement ERC-165 or does not support the `IModule` interface.
- Revert if `manifestHash` does not match the computed Keccak-256 hash of the module's returned manifest. This prevents installation of modules that attempt to install a different module configuration than the one that was approved by the client.
- Revert if any address in `dependencies` does not support the interface at its matching index in the manifest's `dependencyInterfaceIds`, or if the two array lengths do not match, or if any of the dependencies are not already installed on the modular account.

The function MUST record the manifest hash and dependencies that were used for the module's installation. Each dependency's record MUST also be updated to reflect that it has a new dependent. These records MUST be used to ensure calls to `uninstallModule` are comprehensive and undo all edited configuration state from installation. The mechanism by which these records are stored and validated is up to the implementation.

The function MUST store the module's permitted function selectors, permitted external calls, and whether it can spend the account's native tokens, to be able to validate calls to `executeFromModule` and `executeFromModuleExternal`.

The function MUST parse through the execution functions, validation functions, and hooks in the manifest and add them to the modular account after resolving each `ManifestFunction` type.

- Each execution function selector MUST be added as a valid execution function on the modular account. If the function selector has already been added or matches the selector of a native function, the function SHOULD revert.
- If a validation function is to be added to a selector that already has that type of validation function, the function SHOULD revert.

The function MAY store the interface IDs provided in the manifest's `interfaceIds` and update its `supportsInterface` behavior accordingly.

Next, the function MUST call the module's `onInstall` callback with the data provided in the `moduleInstallData` parameter. This serves to initialize the module state for the modular account. If `onInstall` reverts, the `installModule` function MUST revert.

Finally, the function MUST emit the event `ModuleInstalled` with the module's address, the hash of its manifest, and the dependencies that were used.

> **⚠️ The ability to install and uninstall modules is very powerful. The security of these functions determines the security of the account. It is critical for modular account implementers to make sure the implementation of the functions in `IModuleManager` have the proper security consideration and access control in place.**

#### Calls to `uninstallModule`

The function `uninstallModule` accepts 3 parameters: the address of the module to uninstall, a bytes field that may have custom requirements or uses by the implementing account, and ABI-encoded data to pass to the module's `onUninstall` callback.

The function MUST revert if the module is not installed on the modular account.

The function SHOULD perform the following checks:

- Revert if the hash of the manifest used at install time does not match the computed Keccak-256 hash of the module's current manifest. This prevents unclean removal of modules that attempt to force a removal of a different module configuration than the one that was originally approved by the client for installation. To allow for removal of such modules, the modular account MAY implement the capability for the manifest to be encoded in the config field as a parameter.
- Revert if there is at least 1 other installed module that depends on validation functions added by this module. Modules used as dependencies SHOULD NOT be uninstalled while dependent modules exist.

The function SHOULD update account storage to reflect the uninstall via inspection functions, such as those defined by `IModularAccountView`. Each dependency's record SHOULD also be updated to reflect that it has no longer has this module as a dependent.

The function MUST remove records for the module's manifest hash, dependencies, permitted function selectors, permitted external calls, and whether it can spend the account's native tokens.

The function MUST parse through the execution functions, validation functions, and hooks in the manifest and remove them from the modular account after resolving each `ManifestFunction` type. If multiple modules added the same hook, it MUST persist until the last module is uninstalled.

If the account stored the interface IDs provided in the manifest's `interfaceIds` during installation, it MUST remove them and update its `supportsInterface` behavior accordingly. If multiple modules added the same interface ID, it MUST persist until the last module is uninstalled.

Next, the function MUST call the module's `onUninstall` callback with the data provided in the `moduleUninstallData` parameter. This serves to clear the module state for the modular account. If `onUninstall` reverts, execution SHOULD continue to allow the uninstall to complete.

Finally, the function MUST emit the event `ModuleUninstalled` with the module's address and whether the `onUninstall` callback succeeded.

> **⚠️ Incorrectly uninstalled modules can prevent uninstalls of their dependencies. Therefore, some form of validation that the uninstall step completely and correctly removes the module and its usage of dependencies is required.**

### Validation Call Flow

Modular accounts support three different calls flows for validation: user op validation, runtime validation, and signature validation. User op validation happens within the account's implementation of the function `validateUserOp`, defined in the ERC-4337 interface `IAccount`. Runtime validation happens through the dispatcher function `executeWithAuthorization`, or when using direct call validation. Signature validation happens within the account's implementation of the function `isValidSignature`, defined in ERC-1271.

For each of these validation types, an account implementation may specify its own format for selecting which validation function to use, as well as any per-hook data for validation hooks.

Within the implementation of each type of validation function, the modular account MUST check that the provided validation function applies to the given function selector intended to be run. Then, the account MUST execute all pre validation hooks of the corresponding type associated with the validation function in use. These hooks MUST be executed in the order specified during installation. After the execution of pre validation hooks, the account MUST invoke the validation function of the corresponding type. If any pre validation hooks or the validation function revert, the account MUST revert. It SHOULD include the module's revert data within its revert data.

The account MUST define a way to pass data separately for each validation hook and the validation function itself. This data MUST be sent as the `userOp.signature` field for user op validation, the `authorization` field for runtime validation, and the `signature` field for signature validation.

The result of user op validation SHOULD be the intersection of time bounds returned by the pre validation hooks and the validation function. If any validation hooks or the validation functions returns a value of `1` for the authorizer field, indicating a signature verification failure by the ERC-4337 standard, the account MUST return a value of `1` for the authorizer portion of the validation data.

The set of validation hooks run MUST be the hooks specified by account state at the start of validation. In other words, if the set of applicable hooks changes during validation, the original set of hooks MUST still run, and only future invocations of the same validation should reflect the changed set of hooks.

#### Checking Validation Applicability

To enforce module permission isolation, the modular account MUST check validation function applicability as part of each validation function implementation.

User op validation and runtime validation functions have a configurable range of applicability to functions on the account. This can be configured with selectors installed to a validation. Alternatively, a validation installation may specify the `isGlobal` flag as true, which means the account MUST consider it applicable to any module execution function with the `allowGlobalValidation` flag set to true, or for any account native function that the account MAY allow for global validation.

If the selector being checked is `execute` or `executeBatch`, the modular account MUST perform additional checking. If the target of `execute` is the modular account's own address, validation MUST revert, to prevent privilege escalation. If the target of any `Call` within `executeBatch` is the account, the selector of the `Call` MUST also be checked to apply for the given validation. If the batch self-call's selector is again either `execute` or `executeBatch`, validation MUST revert, to prevent privilege escalation without requiring arbitrary-depth calldata decoding.

Installed validations have two flag variables indicating what they may be used for. If a validation is attempted to be used for user op validation and the flag `isUserOpValidation` is set to false, validation MUST revert. If the validation is attempted to be used for signature validation and the flag `isSignatureValidation` is set to false, validation MUST revert.

#### Direct Call Validation.

If a validation function is installed with the entity ID of `0xffffffff`, it may be used as direct call validation. This occurs when a module or other address calls a function on the modular account, without wrapping its call in the dispatcher function `executeWithAuthorization` to use as a selection mechanism for a runtime validation function.

To implement direct call validation, the modular account MUST treat direct function calls that are not from the modular account itself or the EntryPoint as an attempt to validate using the caller's address and the entity ID of `0xffffffff`. If such a validation function is installed, and applies to the function intended to be called, the modular account MUST allow it to continue, without performing runtime validation. Any pre validation hooks and execution hooks installed to this validation function MUST still run.

### Execution Call Flow

For all non-view functions within `IModularAccount` except `executeWithAuthorization`, all module-defined execution functions, and any additional native functions that the modular account MAY wish to include, the modular account MUST adhere to these steps during execution:

If the caller is not the EntryPoint or the account, the account MUST check access control for direct call validation.

Prior to running the target function, the modular account MUST run all pre execution hooks that apply for the current function call. Pre execution hooks apply if they have been installed to the currently running function selector, or if they are installed to the validation function that was used for the current execution. Pre execution hooks MUST run validation-associated hooks first, in the order they were installed, then selector-associated hooks second, in the order they were installed.

Next, the modular account MUST run the target function, either an account native function or a module-defined execution function.

After the execution of the target function, the modular account MUST run any post execution hooks. These MUST be run in the reverse order of the pre execution hooks. If a hook is defined to be both a pre and a post execution hook, and the pre execution hook returned a non-empty `bytes` value to the account, the account MUST pass that data to the post execution hook.

The set of hooks run for a given target function MUST be the hooks specified by account state at the start of the execution phase. In other words, if the set of applicable hooks changes during execution, the original set of hooks MUST still run, and only future invocations of the same target function should reflect the changed set of hooks.

Module execution functions where the field `isPublic` is set to true, or native functions without access control, SHOULD omit the runtime validation step, including any runtime validation hooks. Native functions without access control MAY also omit running execution hooks.

### Extension

#### Semi-modular account

Account implementers MAY choose to design a semi-modular account, where certain features, such as default validation, are integrated into the core account. This approach SHOULD ensure compatibility with fully modular accounts, as defined in this proposal, to maintain interoperability across different implementations.

## Rationale

ERC-4337 compatible accounts must implement the `IAccount` interface, which consists of only one method that bundles validation with execution: `validateUserOp`. A primary design rationale for this proposal is to extend the possible functions for a smart contract account beyond this single method by unbundling these and other functions, while retaining the benefits of account abstraction.

This proposal includes several interfaces that build on ERC-4337. First, we standardize a set of modular functions that allow smart contract developers greater flexibility in bundling validation, execution, and hook logic. We also propose interfaces that provide methods for querying execution functions, validation functions, and hooks on a modular account. The rest of the interfaces describe a module's methods for exposing its modular functions and desired configuration, and the modular account's methods for installing and removing modules and allowing execution across modules and external addresses.

## Security Considerations

The modular smart contract accounts themselves are trusted components. Installed modules are trusted to varying degrees, as modules can interact with an arbitrarily large or small set of resources on an account. For example, a wide-reaching malicious module could add reverting hooks to native function selectors, bricking the account, or add execution functions that may drain the funds of the account. However, it is also possible to install a module with a very narrow domain, and depend on the correctness of the account behavior to enforce its limited access. Users should therefore be careful in what modules to add to their account.

Users should perform careful due diligence before installing a module and should be mindful of the fact that modules are potentially dangerous. The module's manifest can give users an understanding of the potential risks they are exposed to for that particular module. For instance, a request to install certain validation functions and/or hooks on certain execution selectors could potentially be a vector for DOS.

Execution hooks have no awareness of other execution hooks being performed in the same function selector execution setting. Since execution hooks can perform state changes, this reveals an important security consideration: An execution hook can only assure that at the time of its own execution, certain conditions are met, but this can not be generalized to the entire pre execution context of potentially multiple pre execution hooks. For example, a pre execution hook cannot be assured that the storage it performed validation upon does not get further updated in subsequent pre execution hooks. Even a post execution hook potentially repeating the validation cannot assure that the storage remains unmodified because a prior post execution hook may have reset the state. As long as the requirements checked by a module as part of an execution hook are only modifiable by the module itself, this can be considered safe.
